positive ER PR were assigned ER+PR+ subtype HER2- ER- PR-negative samples were assigned triple-negative subtype Subtype assignment intrinsic genes mapped Affymetrix microarray was hierarchical clustering Pearson correlation Samples were assigned higher-resolution subtype gene expression centroid had highest Spearman correlation Analysis Genome-Wide Copy Number Alterations May genome release was divided nonoverlapping segments representative copy number segments SNP was calculated taking median GLAD-segmented copy number SNPs found fraction segments gains losses was counted range gain loss thresholds were observed entire genome was divided cytobands according boundaries available release hg17 UCSC genome browser ref shown Kruskal-Wallis tests were evaluate association gain loss frequency subtype Gene Expression Signatures Chromosomal instability CIN25 RB signatures were calculated mean MAS5 expression level relevant genes scaled have mean value Wilcoxon rank sum test was evaluate subtype differences Association Copy Number Subtypes unique set copy number segment boundaries tumor samples was define boundaries genomic intervals segmented copy number value interval is constant tumor sample further analysis intervals including SNPs absolute log copy number ratio tumors were selected Association copy number alteration interval subtype was evaluated two-sample t test False discovery rates were estimated q value procedure Intervals q values were tested same analysis procedure breast cancer cell lines intervals showing consistent association P were selected Identification Candidate Driver Genes regions notable copy number gain were identified multiplying mean gain amplitude gain frequency Expression levels samples copy number alteration were compared two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum test log copy number ratio ‚àí03 was identify samples losses ratio was identify samples gains Association expression clinical outcome time distant metastasis was evaluated vant Veer microarray probes were assigned genes mapping genome BLAT finding overlaps alignments RefSeq mRNA sequences UCSC ref release region relationship expression level time distant metastasis was estimated Cox proportional hazards model significance level was calculated likelihood ratio test P value thresholds were adjustments multiple testing analysis are limited prioritizing candidates follow-up do provide statistical evidence individual gene is driver Somatic Mutation Breast Cell Lines Exonic regions were amplified PCR genomic DNA sequenced directions Big Dye Terminator Kit reagents ABI PRISM sequencing machines Applied Biosystems Sequence variants were identified Mutation Surveyor software SoftGenetics confirmed manual trace review second round sequencing Matched nontumor samples were available confirm variants are somatic Oncogenes tend be subject small number recurrent activating mutations genes analyzed mutations have been shown be somatic other studies tumor suppressors wider variety mutations impair function considered variants do correspond record dbSNP change amino acid sequence is possible few variants represent novel polymorphisms insignificant mutations vast majority correspond somatic mutations most rest introduce frameshifts are likely protein inactivation Associations mutation status subtype were evaluated two-sided Fishers exact test Western Blotting Equal amounts protein were separated electrophoresis NuPage Bis-Tris 4% gradient gels Invitrogen Proteins were transferred polyvinylidene difluoride membranes Criterion system Bio-Rad Specific antigen-antibody interaction was detected horseradish peroxidase‚Äìconjugated secondary antibody IgG enhanced chemiluminescence Western blotting detection reagents Amersham Biosciences anti-PTEN antibody Santa Cruz Biotechnology was anti‚Äìglyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase antibody Abcam loading control anti-MYST2 antibody Santa Cruz Biotechnology was anti-actin antibody
